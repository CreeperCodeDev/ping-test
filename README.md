# ping-test

UI to run a ping test on any host using `http` or `https` protocol

> The [JavaScript](ping.js) responsible for the ping uses `fetch` functionality with `no-cors` mode to avoid being
> blocked by CORS pre-flight request.

[Demo](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/thevickypedia/ping-test/blob/main/ping.html)

> :bulb: The demo link uses GitHub preview page, so the ping rate is from GitHub's server locations.
> Also ensure to set `protocol` as HTTPS when using the demo link.
